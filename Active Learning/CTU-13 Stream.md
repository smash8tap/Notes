## To do's

- Extract botnet data points and check the accuracy on just the botnet class

## Combination of categorical and numerical data
- Alternative is to use generalized additive models (GAM's)
-  Distance metrics that can be used:
	- Levenshtien distance (or any form of "edit distance")

	- Longest common subsequence metric

	- Gower distance
	- cosine distance
