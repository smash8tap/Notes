# Infrastructure 
- Banks
-  Primary Validator
-  Confirmation Validator
-  Balance lock

## Questions
1. How are [[Confirmation Validator]]and [[Primary Validator]] validating a certain block (since there is no PoW)
2. How do we become banks and PV
3. How well data validation is done on the TNB desktop software. Can we inject some malicious code as the friends account number?
4.  Can we own more than 50% (maybe more if we incorporate weights) of a banks confirmation validator and trick the bank to choose me as Primary Validator 
5.  What allows a Primary Validator in not modifying the blockchains data(balance lock) so that it can keep processing it again again?
