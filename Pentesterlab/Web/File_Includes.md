# Intro

- File include vulnerabilities come from a lack of filtering when a user-controlled parameter is used as part of a file name in a call to an including function(php):
  - require
  - require_once
  - include
  - include_once
- File include vulns can be used as **Directory Traversal** vulns
- This could lead to RFI and LFI.
