## LDAP Syntax

- To retrieve a user based on its username, we can do the following: `(cn=[INPUT])`
- To add more conditions we can do the following:
  - A boolean OR using |: To get the records matching [INPUT1] or [INPUT2]
    `(|(cn=[INPUT1])(cn=[INPUT2]) )`
  - a boolean 'AND' using &: to get records for which the cn matches [INPUT1] and the password matches [INPUT2].
    `(& (cn=[INPUT1])(password=[INPUT2]) )`

(&(username=hac)(pass=))
